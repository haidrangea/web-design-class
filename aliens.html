        <h2 class="w3-serif">What Are Aliens?</h2>
        <p class="w3-red">Aliens are, essentially, spiritual organisms that exist due to human spirituality.
            This can be proven in many ways; read philosophy for more answers. If you wish to 
            create your own alien, this can be done quite easily. Simply create a "spiritual space",
            a space free from impurities or evil spirits/demons, align all of your chakras, ensure that
            the constellation above you is the same as your Moon sign, and focus your energy, using spiritual
            crystals as a medium to project your energy into. With this method, you will summon an alien 
            and he will be trapped inside of this crystal. If you are sufficiently powerful, or sufficiently
            brave, you may break this alien free of his crystalline prison and let him loose in the world.
            Keep him on a tight leash though, as aliens are known for their contempt for humanity. 
            If you lack sufficient power, DO NOT let your alien out of its crystal. This is a GRAVE MISTAKE
            that is known to have led to the deaths of many a sorcerer. If you cannot determine whether or not
            you are powerful enough, or have acquired a completely new species of alien, DO NOT LET IT OUT.
            Below, a list of known alien species can be found:

        <p class="w3-blue">Pfhor: They are bipedal, taller than humans, have three red eyes in a triangle formation, and gray skin. 
            They are known to follow some sort of religion, and have a very complex bureaucracy. They 
            are well known for enslaving humans.
        </p>
        <p>Grays: These aliens are short, with very spindly limbs, gigantic heads, big black eyes, and 
            gray skin. They are known for using the "flying saucer" in order to traverse the cosmos. 
            They frequently abduct cows and humans in order to perform experiments related to the development
            of baby humans, how baby humans are raised, the effect of milk on human babies, and the human
            concept of "consciousness". 
        </p>
        <p>Nordle: Greatly resemble humans, especially those from the region on Earth known as "Scandinavia".
            In fact, the race of Humans are descended from Nordles, who arrived in northern europe 
            from the star Aldebaran around eight thousand years ago. They came into contact with Great 
            Ape tribes, which led to the race of Humans we have today. Nordles are very tall, powerful, 
            motivated, driven, honest, and honorable, and are known to greatly venerate their ancestors.
        </p>
        <p class="w3-text-red">Oa: The Oa are a race of floating slime balls. When asexually concepted, they appear as 
            a plume of teal liquid underwater near the shore. This eventually forms into a ball of
            slime that will float off of the ground. This ball has a large eye, allowing the Oa
            to see, and two to four "orbitals" of stickier slime that is connected to the main 
            body with a white tendril, allowing the Oa to use the "orbitals" as limbs.
            The Oa is always connected to its birthplace with a telephone cord-like tendril that feeds 
            it water passively.
