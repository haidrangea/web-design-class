        <h2 class="w3-serif">Alien-Human Interactions</h2>
        <p>Throughout history, there have been MANY, MANY interactions between humans and aliens. 
            These include but are not limited to: Area 51, Roswell, among others. However, I am
            here to divulge information upon those interactions more esoteric in nature. Firstly, 
            we have the False Human Incident, recorded over the course of April 1951. 
            <br> <br>
            This story follow our protagonist, Emily Johansson, and her husband, Jacob Johansson.
            They lived a quiet life as farmers in rural Iowa. However, Emily once stayed up a bit
            too late during the night-time. When she looked out at the cows' pasture, she saw 
            a FLYING SAUCER STEALING ALL OF THEM. Frightened, she went to the bedroom to wake up
            Jacob. However, what she saw frightened her: Jacob was gone. Frantically, she ran outside
            and begged the aliens to return her husband and take her instead. Thus, she was swept up
            into the UFO by the tractor beam. However, what she saw after shocked her. Her husband, 
            Jacob Johansson, WAS AN ALIEN. Emily was promptly probed and then killed. This was all 
            recorded by the family dog, who has an inexplicable ability to make his barks understandable
            to human ears.

            Secondly, there is the ALIEN-HUMAN HYBRID. This story follows one Salvatore, last name unknown.
            Salvatore was walking down the streets of Sicily, where he had lived his whole life. The sky was 
            dark and cloudy, due to the nighttime that it was. He walked, and walked, and walked, until
            he realized he had left the city limits and was walking on a downtrodden dirt path. However, 
            he kept walking, because of his strong sense of wonder and curiosity. This was a grave mistake.
            An alien UFO came and abducted him. It is then when a horrid experiment was conducted: the creation
            of a human-alien hybrid. Salvatore was restrained to a table and introduced to a female alien
            while the alien scientists watched to take notes. I'll let you infer what happens next. 9 months
            later, Salvatore Junior was born. He had pinkish gray skin, large eyeballs with pupils, and long,
            spindly limbs. He also had mutated vocal chords, allowing him to make both human and alien sounds.
            This actually led him to becoming a rich and famous translator for human-alien business deals.
            However, Salvatore Junior died in 2003 from liver failure and did not produce any heirs, leaving
            the Human-Alien bloodline to go extinct. We can only hope another experiment will be conducted
            by aliens soon.
